\addchap{Abstract}
It is proposed an iterative solver for large linear systems, and it 
is implemented in R library \texttt{fdaPDE}.
The equations originate from a functional minimization problem
that is discretized with finite elements. In fact,
in such context of mixed-effects models,
each statistical unit increases the size of the system by $2 N_{\tau}$, twice the number of
the finite elements degrees of freedom.\newline
To make computing a solution possible, at each iteration are solved 
$m$ linear systems of dimensions $\left(2 N_{\tau}\right)^2$,
$m$ being the number of statistical unit, instead of one of
dimensions $\left(2m N_{\tau}\right)^2$.\newline
A simulation study is carried out and the proposed
method is finally applied to fMRI data in the cerebral cortex.
