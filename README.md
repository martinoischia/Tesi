to download the latest release of this template.

# Customization
All the template styles and options are in the `mat-polimi.tex` file:
edit its content depending on your needs.

> **Note**: by default, the bibliography is compiled through the `biber` backend,
> which is more modern and customizable than the standard `bibtex` one.<br />
> Make sure your LaTeX editor uses `biber` as a default bibliography backend.<br />
> **Only** in case of troubles, change the `biblatex` package options to `backend=bibtex`.

# Demo
A demo of the resulting `pdf` is available [here](thesis.pdf).
