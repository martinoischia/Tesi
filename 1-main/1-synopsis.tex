\chapter{Synopsis}
\label{ch:synopsis}

Here goes the synopsis of your thesis. It consists of an introductory part followed by a description on the thesis content. 

This thesis is organized as follows.

At the $i$-th statistical unit, the observation $j$, for $j = 1 \dots n_i$, is modeled as
\begin{equation}
    \label{model}
    z_{ij} = \bm{w}_{ij}^T \bm{\beta} + \bm{v}_{ij}^T \bm{b}_i + f_i(\bm{p_{ij}}) + \epsilon_{ij}
\end{equation}
$\epsilon_{ij}$, for every $i$ and $j$, are the random noise or errors, considered as the realizations of independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variables, with mean $0$ and variance $\sigma^2$.
