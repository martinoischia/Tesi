\chapter{Synopsis}
\label{ch:synopsis}

This thesis is organized as follows.\\
Chapter 2 introduces the spatial regression with PDE regularization
models and and mixed-effects models. Chapter 3 describes the iterative
method proposed for solving problems with a large number of
statistical units or in general large matrices generated by this
type of models.
Chapter 4 describes the statistical properties of the estimated parameters.
Chapter 5 illustrates the simulations that have been performed to
validate the proposed method. Chapter 6 shows an application of these
models to several patients' fMRI data. Chapter 7 summarizes the results
of this work.
